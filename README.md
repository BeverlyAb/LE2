# LE2 - MataHacks Submission 
This app was inspired by the **Black Lives Matter Movement.** Through the use of our phones, we're able to document
when a mundane routine, such as being pulled over, can escalate to something dreadfully more serious.

When we are at the discretion of higher authority, bad things may happen. Civilians may feel skittish, anxious, or scared even though 
we should feel safe at the presence of law enforcements. In worse situations we may actually be at the mercy of law enforcements
who may intentionally misinform people, so that they unknowingly relinquish their rights.

This is where **Law Enforcer - Enforcer** or **LE2** comes in. I understand that not all police intentionally misinform citizens, but this provides
a quick, active double check of everyone's rights in case of confrontation. LE2's goal is to provide reassurance, ease of mind, 
and safety as we all try to follow the law of the land. 

This mobile iOS app utilizes Apple's Speech to interact and communicate with civilians discreetly while they are confronted by law enforcements. 
The role playing example [here](https://imgur.com/a/fldUca2) demonstrates how LE2 interjects when their user's rights are in danger of being undermined.
